This story begins way back in 2016, with two roommate sims when their friendship became more.

Sara Yootz, always the hot-head;

and Jane Witt, the creative soul.

They had been living together in the small Daisy Hovel for some time. One evening Sara had finished her workout and Jane was getting ready for bed, when Sara decided to take the advice from her friend Don from the gym & make the first move.

It definately surprised Jane, but

but she liked it,

she liked it a lot.

Sara supressed a giggle.

"It's the hat isn't it?" Jane reach for the brim, "Do you think it's too much?"

"No... ok maybe it is, but I like it." Sara glance around the night club. "How about a dance?"

One morning, while Jane was in the shower and Sara was doing her morning workout, she decided to surprise Jane again.

<!-- One morning not long after their date, it was during Sara's usual ealy morning workout -->

<!-- that she decided to surprise Jane again. -->

![](12-22-16_4-47-03%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-22-16_4-47-43%C2%A0PM.png)

They decided to waste no time,

![](12-22-16_5-18-40%C2%A0PM.png)

and eloped that same day.

![](12-22-16_5-18-49%C2%A0PM.png)

----

![](12-22-16_5-51-37%C2%A0PM.png)

They went on another date at the same club as before to celebrate.

----

For a time, normal life roled on, spending time together, at their jobs, and pursuing their respective hobbies.

![](12-22-16_5-29-37%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara got more tips from Don, including protient shakes.

----

![](12-22-16_6-15-41%C2%A0PM.png)

"Hey Jane, does it look like I've put on any weight to you?" Sara asked inbetween breathes as she ran on the tredmil.

"I think you look just prefect, my love."

![](12-22-16_6-19-08%C2%A0PM.png)

----

The next day Sara had off work happened to be a day Jane had to work. So, Sara decide to use the time to get in some extra workouts. She pushed herself as hard as she could.

![](12-22-16_6-34-09%C2%A0PM.png)

"You aren't getting the better of me!" was one of the many things she yelled in the empty house, pushing herself harder and harder to try to lose the extra cub from her middle.

![](12-22-16_6-35-20%C2%A0PM.png)

That is, until she suddenly knew she was going to be sick.

![](12-22-16_6-38-54%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara barely made it to the bathroom.

![](12-22-16_6-39-47%C2%A0PM.png)

She didn't know what think as she tried to clean up the mess.

----

It turned out to be the first time of many. So, Sara tried chaning a few things. She dropped the protien drinks, and generally tried to be easier on herself. But it didn't seem to make any difference.

![](12-22-16_6-48-29%C2%A0PM.png)

''*When am I going to get over this... whatever it is?'* she found herself wondering.

----

She even skipped her morning workouts sometimes.

![](12-22-16_7-05-47%C2%A0PM.png)

"How about I make us some breakfast?" Jane offered.

"Yeah, sure." Sara said. Her stomach still wasn't doing that great, but she didn't want to worry Jane too much.

![](12-22-16_6-28-03%C2%A0PM.png)

The food was great, but it still went down rough for Sara. She managed to keep it from showing until Jane stood up to take their dirty dishes to the kitchen.

![](12-22-16_6-31-15%C2%A0PM.png)

"Oh," Sara moaned and held her rioting stomach. *'Can't I keep anything down?'* she thought.

"Still feeling under the weather, dear?" Jane sat back down across from Sara. "Look, I've been kind of wondering lately; what if you're pregnant."

"Wait," Sara closed her eyes, "is that eve possible? But we're... How would..."

![](12-22-16_6-32-20%C2%A0PM.png)

"I'm not sure, but it would explain a lot."

"I need some time to think..." Sara stood. "Like, I need a minute."

Sara went to their bedroom and sat on their bed, and tried to sort through her racing thoughts.

----

Jane waited a short while, before she softly knocked on the door and came in to check on Sara.

"You might be right," Sara admitted,

![](12-22-16_6-54-18%C2%A0PM.png)

"But this is not something I ever though I'd have to... I didn't think I even could get... like with anyone." Sara couldn't even put all the words together.

![](12-22-16_6-54-33%C2%A0PM.png)

"I know." Jane pulled her close. "Trust me, I didn't expect this either."

She rubbed her wife's back for a minute as they embraced.

As they pulled back from the hug,

![](12-22-16_6-55-45%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane gave her a peck on the cheek.

----

"Hey there sweeite," Jane came around the couch, "how you doing?"

![](12-22-16_6-50-48%C2%A0PM.png)

"Better, I think." Sara tried a tenative smile, "How about you?"

![](12-22-16_6-51-01%C2%A0PM.png)

"Honestly, I'm so excited that we're going to be parents. Have you thought about any names?"

"I haven't, not yet anyway."

----

Taking it easy on herself included less time at the gym. So Sara invited over her buddy Don so they could catch up some.

![](12-22-16_7-31-53%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-22-16_7-30-48%C2%A0PM.png)

Bonding with her friend helped Sara feel like herself.

![](12-22-16_7-34-51%C2%A0PM.png)

"You ok there?" Don asked.

Sara swallowed and waited to see what her stomach was going to do. Thankfully, the feeling passed pretty quickly this time. "Yeah, apperently it's totally normal to just feel sick like, the entire time."

![](12-22-16_7-35-37%C2%A0PM.png)

"Honestly that's probably the worst part; it's just like how am I supposed to get used to this, you know? I can't eat hardly anything; my endurance is totally shot." Sara guestered with her arm.

"Give it time, I'm sure you'll get it back afterwards."

![](12-22-16_7-35-00%C2%A0PM.png)

"Yeah, I guess you're right." Sara turned to the TV. "Just pisses me off."

"I bet it isn't as bad as you say."

"Is that a challange?" She looked at him out of the side of her eye.

"Go get your gym clothes and get on that tredmil."

![](12-22-16_7-38-57%C2%A0PM.png)

----

![](12-22-16_7-42-16%C2%A0PM.png)

Then the next morning when they were getting ready for the day...

![](12-22-16_7-00-33%C2%A0PM.png)

"Last night was amazing." Jane smiled.

"Tell me about it." Sara grinned back.

"Do you mind if I..." Jane held her hand near Sara's belly.

"Go head." Sara pushed her belly out.

![](12-22-16_7-01-37%C2%A0PM.png)

"Did you feel that kick?"

![](12-22-16_7-01-45%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara's grin grew as she looked deep in Jane's eyes and gave a little nod.

----

![](12-22-16_7-17-06%C2%A0PM.png)

"How was your workout?" Jane asked when Sara got off the tredmil.

![](12-22-16_7-18-33%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara sat with her. "Good, it really helps to move my body around, get the muscles working."

![](12-22-16_7-18-48%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-22-16_7-18-39%C2%A0PM.png)

<!-- ----

![](12-22-16_7-08-48%C2%A0PM.png)

The neasuea was still presistent,

![](12-22-16_7-21-14%C2%A0PM.png)

But Sara tried her best to eat what she could for the sake of both herself and the baby.  -->

----

![](12-22-16_7-45-04%C2%A0PM.png)

Before she knew it, her belly had grown even larger.

![](12-22-16_7-47-30%C2%A0PM.png)

To the point that swimming was just about the only form of exercise she could do anymore.

![](12-22-16_7-54-53%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-22-16_7-55-34%C2%A0PM.png)

But Jane helped her through it.

----

![](12-23-16_1-26-06%C2%A0PM.png)

----

![](12-23-16_1-44-08%C2%A0PM.png)

"Um I think..."

![](12-23-16_1-53-52%C2%A0PM.png)

"Jane, it's definately time! Ahh!"

Once that contraction passed, Jane replied, "Then let's get you to the bedroom, just like we planned."

![](12-23-16_2-03-03%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane stayed with her the whole time.

![](12-23-16_2-05-46%C2%A0PM.png)

Turns out, Sara had twin girls. Savanna & Emma Yootz.
