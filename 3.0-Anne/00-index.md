Even after the festivals, Anne continued to explore her romantic side.

She worked her charms,

and they were quite effective for her.

Very effective indeed.

At the same time, she came into her own as a vampire.

Proving her place amoung other vampire and the members of her mother's coven.

"Hey mom," Anne held her stomach, "I've been avoiding solid food like you said, but here recently-" she burped then swallowed, "Oh, excuse me... here recently... what else can make vampires feel queezy? Because that some sort of neasous feeling has started to come back."

"Well, as far as I know, just pregnancy. So congratulations sweetie." Sara smiled as she hugged her daughter.

"And you can always wait a bit then take a test if you want to."

Anne decided she would, having fun as she waited for some time to pass.

And positive was her result.

But that didn't stop her fun.

When she told Emma, her sister suggested they learn more about how to care for the little one.

Jane was excited, naturally.

![](06-14-18_7-32-28%C2%A0AM.png)

Anne read even more about vampires, just to be as ready as she could.

![](06-14-18_7-36-36%C2%A0AM.png)

She took some time to relax

"Hi there little niece or nehew!" Emma said.

![](06-14-18_10-16-34%C2%A0AM.png)![](06-14-18_10-25-16%C2%A0AM.png)![](06-14-18_10-26-21%C2%A0AM.png)

Of course, it was news shared with the whole coven.

![](06-14-18_10-54-40%C2%A0AM.png)

"Feels strong, as a born vampire of a born vampire should be." - `Actually no, this child is human. This is Cassandra that Anne is preggers with here so idk.`

"Time flies! Seems like it was just yesterday that you were that little!" Don said. "Congratulations!"

![](06-17-18_8-03-37%C2%A0AM.png)

"Mom, I think... Ah!"

![](06-17-18_8-03-54%C2%A0AM.png)



![](06-17-18_8-06-42%C2%A0AM.png)

Once it passed, Sara pulled her in for a hug. "Don't worry, you got this Anne."

![](06-17-18_9-43-48%C2%A0AM.png)![](06-17-18_9-45-32%C2%A0AM.png)

So everyone was there when Cassandra, daughter of Anne Yootz and Maki Hasegawa, was born.
