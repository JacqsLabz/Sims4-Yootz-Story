*The next morning... / One morning a few days later...*

"Hey sweetie, how you doing?" Sara asked.

"I don't think I got any sleep after last night." Jane struggled to keep her eyes open.

"How about I make you some breakfast for once?" Sara smiled.

Jane nodded.

When it was finished, Sara sat down next to her again.

"One omlette, with love."

"You're too cute sweetie." Jane smiled.

"Let me know what you think; at this point I don't think my taste for food will even come back."

Jane took a tenative bite. After the chewed and swallowed, "It tastes fine, thank you sweetie."

Sara smiled. "You're welcome. I know this a bit last minute, but Don invited us to a party later today, did you want to come with me?"

After she finished another bite, "Yeah, that sounds nice. A little coffee should help wake me up."

"Cool. I think he said it's a birthday party for one of his roommates?"

"Oh..." Jane held her stomach as pain filled her middle.

"Ow." Jane sucked in air through her teeth, making a slight hiss, "Does this mean I won't be able to eat either?"

"Well, for me it was a neasous feeling, and the flavor was gross. So you're probably fine?"

Jane waited for the feeling to pass

"It's been great to see you and catch up!" Sara gave Don a bro hug.

"Actually part of the reason I invited you was because I wanted to ask you something..." he leaned in close.

"Can you turn other people into vampire? Is that a think you can do."

Sara raised an eyebrow, "Really? Are you sure you want that?"

"You're immoralt, right? Who wouldn't want that?"

Sara noddeed, back up a little, and channeled the dark energy of the vampires.

Sara released the dark energy, and let her disguse come back.

"Oh shit, ow!"

"It'll feel like that for a while, give it time."
