Strange puddles started to appear around the house for what seemed like no reason.

"Emma?" Jane squinted, she thought she was seeing a ghost.

Emma faded away, but Jane went to find Sara. To help bring their daughter back.

So, Jane asked Sara if she could help bring her back.

Sara explained her plan; she taught Jane how to fish and explained whta they would need from the garden.

Eventually, Emma appeared to everyone.

"Emma!" Sara embraced her small ghostly form. "We're going to bring you back sweetie, I'm so sorry."

"Thanks mom." Emma's voice was an unearthly echo, but still soothing to Sara.

Anne didn't have a strong reaaction, even when Emma's ghost started a bear phase.

Jane stood before the fidge. "Are you sure you want me to do this?"

"You're far better at cooking than me," Sara said, "you do the honors."

Jane took too a deep breath, "Ok."

for Emma.

The magic didn't take long

to fill her spirit, and return her to the mortal plane with a body.

Sara covered her in kisses. "My girl, you're back."

![](12-21-17_11-48-42%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane held her close. "I'm sorry I doubted this could happen baby."

![](12-21-17_11-49-41%C2%A0PM.png)

Anne hugged her too, happy to have her other big sister back. "Emma!"

Emma decided purple was her favorite color now.
