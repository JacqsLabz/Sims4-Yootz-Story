# Sims4 Yootz Story

My save in the sims 4 where everything went crazy. It started off as me exploring the game with 2 adult sims that were roommates, but became my main save file that I found myself returning to. In typical sims fashion, everything got weird.

**Please note:** this is a super early rougth first draft, everything within is subject to change. I'm still working things out, even major plot points.
