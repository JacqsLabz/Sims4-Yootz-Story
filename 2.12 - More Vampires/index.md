Anne asked questions about being a vampire, and how things would be when she grew up.

Anne & Emma spent a lot of time together.

----

Because she had been a ghost for so long, Emma stayed a child for much longer than her twin sister. But her birthday did still happen.

Emma even changed her hair.

----

Soon after, she also had a talk with her parents, but this one was very different.

"I've been thinking... do you think I'm old enough for the vampire bite? You know, cause it would safer, right?"

"I actually like that idea, what do you think dear?" Sara asked Jane.

Jane nodded, "Yeah, go for it."

![](05-21-18_11-58-25%C2%A0AM.png)

So once again, Sara called on the dark power of the vampires.

![](05-21-18_11-59-05%C2%A0AM.png)

Sara took from Emma's neck, then offered her own wrist.

![](05-21-18_11-59-41%C2%A0AM.png)

"Wait, I have to drink your blood?"

"Go for it!" Jane cheered her on.

![](05-21-18_12-00-01%C2%A0PM.png)

"Oh that feels so weird!" Emma moaned, then burped.

----

Later, Emma tried eating some regular food to see how she reacted to it.

![](05-21-18_12-01-13%C2%A0PM.png)

And found she could take it just fine.

![](05-21-18_12-01-19%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-21-18_12-01-37%C2%A0PM.png)

She thought it was bit strange to not even have the reaction Jane had told her about, but at the same time it was nice to still enjoy food.

----

They of course invited over the other members of the coven to welcome in Emma.

![](05-21-18_12-11-51%C2%A0PM.png)

Emma got the chance to talk to Lilith and Don at the bar.

"Oh..." Emma held her middle.

"Oh yeah, I rememmber that part; my gut gave me so much hell."

"It's actually not been painful for me."

"Ingreeging, I've never head of that." Lilith said.

"Really? How does it feel for you then?" Don asked.

![](05-21-18_12-15-16%C2%A0PM.png)

"It's hard to describe..." Emma paused, "Almost like when I ate the abrosa."

"You may have a physical body," Lilith said, "but you still have a connection with the other side of death, young one."

----

The more Emma notied how the waves felt, the more Lilith's words came back to her. Was she still part ghost in some way?

----

![](05-21-18_5-34-15%C2%A0PM.png)

"Give it a try." Sara said.

![](05-21-18_5-34-53%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-21-18_5-39-45%C2%A0PM.png)

----

![](05-21-18_7-48-20%C2%A0PM.png)

Emma decided she had some reading to do.

----

![](05-21-18_7-54-32%C2%A0PM.png)

They added a pool to the basement.

![](05-21-18_7-55-40%C2%A0PM.png)

and a coffin

The next time their coven got together, Lilith had some big news: Emma wouldn't be the newest vampire for long.

![](05-22-18_9-29-56%C2%A0AM.png)

![](05-22-18_9-30-07%C2%A0AM.png)

![](05-22-18_9-31-10%C2%A0AM.png)

Plus, Emma and Anne became best friends.

----

I didn't get an pictures for it, but the father of Lilith's unborn child is Alexandra Goth, married and changed his name to Alexander Bheeda (when he married Jayceon Bheeda, son of Arun Bheeda and Jesminder Bheeda). Lilith named her daughter Kaylie Vatore. And Kaylie comes up again later, in a while.

Look things got weird in this save. Vlad birthed a son with Morter Goth before Morter died, and I had NOTHING to do with that, ok? Yes I put in MC CC, but I didn't tell it to do that.
