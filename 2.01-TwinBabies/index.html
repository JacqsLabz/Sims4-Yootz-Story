<p>Giving birth to not one, but two baby girls left Sara weakened and tired. So at first, she kept her workouts infrequent and stuck with only gentle swimming as she recovered.</p>
<p>Jane got both girls to sleep at the same time as Sara was outside swimming. Jane figured Sara was probably nearly done, so she went out to the front porch to see Sara struggle to pull herself up out of the water. Jane called out, &quot;Hey there you.&quot; Jane made her way down towards the pool. &quot;How you holding up?&quot;</p>
<p>Sara sighed as she started walking towards her wife, &quot;I&#39;m ok I guess? Still exhaushed, feels like I can hardly move sometimes. My body just isn&#39;t capable of anything impressive for now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sara,&quot; Jane met her half way, and took Sara&#39;s hands in her own, &quot;don&#39;t be so hard on yourself. You have achieved a great, enormous physical feat.&quot;</p>

<p>Sara tilted her head to one side just a little. &quot;I did?&quot; Sara didn&#39;t follow, Jane couldn&#39;t mean her swimming.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, silly. You made not just one life, but two. Two beautiful baby girls.&quot; Jane hugged her close. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you how happy I am that we have a family of our own; I admire how strong you are.&quot;</p>
<p>In many ways, those words changed how Sara saw the entire pregnancy. It helped her realize she had seen as something inflected on her, even after she had accepted it. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Sara said in equal parts to her wife, and to her own body for being able of something so amazing.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t long before Sara recovered so she could return to work and start getting back into shape.</p>

<p>She found she liked breast feeding their girls,</p>

<p>and that her muscle tone returned pretty quickly.</p>
