Remembering old times after a romance festival

![](06-03-18_10-59-17%C2%A0PM.png)
Fused?

![](06-03-18_6-37-54%C2%A0AM.png)
Who needs shoes?

![](06-04-18_1-58-25%C2%A0PM.png)
Just like old times.

![](06-04-18_4-27-12%C2%A0PM.png)
WTF

![](06-05-18_6-47-11%C2%A0AM.png)
Oops

![](06-05-18_6-49-13%C2%A0AM.png)
I think Grim is sick of my shit.

![](06-05-18_7-44-20%C2%A0AM.png)
Ok this time it's totally my fault.

![](06-06-18_11-13-19%C2%A0AM.png)
"What's everybody looking at?"

![](06-06-18_11-19-50%C2%A0AM.png)
Coffins are healing for vampires.... so......

![](06-06-18_11-42-24%C2%A0AM.png)
Out of hibernation on her

![](06-06-18_12-10-13%C2%A0PM.png)
The vase that finished the collection :)

![](06-06-18_2-10-39%C2%A0PM.png)
"Fly here as bat" -> Yes, that is flying and you are all bats. Just keep telling yourselves that. WTF.

![](06-12-18_10-27-10%C2%A0PM.png)
Time for the girls to learn to parent!

![](06-14-18_10-01-54%C2%A0AM.png)
Our pet has no eyes.....

![](06-14-18_10-13-36%C2%A0AM.png)
Back from the opera and heavily pregnant.

![](06-14-18_10-55-34%C2%A0AM.png)
As the family grows...

![](06-14-18_9-42-45%C2%A0AM.png)
This is how classy we are -.-

![](06-19-18_1-52-27%C2%A0PM.png)
I did nothing to cause this......

![](06-19-18_10-12-30%C2%A0PM.png)
So we have: Anne's morning sickness, Sara being lost, Jane still not accpeting being a vampire, Cassandra hella confused, and Emma crying. Yap. This family is great on vaca.

![](06-19-18_10-14-06%C2%A0PM.png)
Emma has stomach issues, and worries that she's not going to be able to eat food here soon, like her sister and Sara.

![](06-19-18_10-18-19%C2%A0PM.png)
Too scared to find out rather she can still eat solid food and not willing to bite humans, Emma turns to liquid-fied blood fruit.

![](06-19-18_10-19-48%C2%A0PM.png)
Because one way or the other, her thirst demands to be fed.

![](06-19-18_10-23-38%C2%A0PM.png)
Well hello there death

![](06-19-18_10-24-15%C2%A0PM.png)
Being out in the woods makes it easier for Anne my make sure the child growing in her is properly nurished.

![](06-19-18_10-25-25%C2%A0PM.png)
Even if the morning sickness is a pain.

![](06-19-18_10-26-26%C2%A0PM.png)
Death is excited about new life, or unlife? This one should be a vampire.

![](06-19-18_10-29-57%C2%A0PM.png)
Emma cares WAY too much about card games, lol.

![](06-19-18_10-31-41%C2%A0PM.png)
Over cards and alone on the deck, Emma confides in her sister Anne about her stomach and fears. Anne reassures her about it.

![](06-19-18_10-34-22%C2%A0PM.png)
lol, their faces. Anne: omg, could she be more annoying?

![](06-19-18_10-34-59%C2%A0PM.png)
Anne: I promise, it's not as bad as you're making it out to be. No where near as bad. I'm sure you'll be fine.

![](06-19-18_10-36-22%C2%A0PM.png)
Anne:I know you'll be fine, either way.
Emma: Well that makes one of us.

![](06-19-18_10-40-14%C2%A0PM.png)
Sara joined them, as reassured Emma too. Anne's morning sickness acted up a little, but it wasn't a real issue.

![](06-19-18_11-38-02%C2%A0PM.png)
Emma's stomach continued to act weird while she put on a bit of weight.

![](06-19-18_11-42-08%C2%A0PM.png)
"This can't be a vampirism!"

![](06-19-18_11-49-00%C2%A0PM.png)
Out on a hike, she noticed the Grim Reaper fishing.

![](06-19-18_11-49-42%C2%A0PM.png)
Old friends you could say....

"I'm not coming up on your list again any time soon, right?"

![](06-19-18_11-57-25%C2%A0PM.png)
Knowing she didn't near death, Emma went hiking to clear her mind. Her body was changing yet again, how she wasn't totally sure.

![](06-19-18_5-22-20%C2%A0PM.png)

Pancakes
![](06-19-18_5-30-10%C2%A0PM.png)
Party in the closet/hall?

![](06-19-18_6-06-01%C2%A0PM.png)
I'll take them all! (then figure out which ones I don't have later at home)

![](06-19-18_8-59-43%C2%A0PM.png)
Dance Off!

![](06-20-18_10-48-57%C2%A0AM.png)
Emma: Can you check on my baby again?

![](06-20-18_11-11-30%C2%A0PM.png)
I have no words. No words. You better not come back knocked up.....

![](06-20-18_11-42-52%C2%A0PM.png)
Daughters and granddaughters.

![](06-20-18_12-02-54%C2%A0AM.png)
Though that didn't stop her gut from adding up.

![](06-20-18_12-04-22%C2%A0AM.png)
And she wasn't sure if the glowing sparks would ever stop being unsettling to see.

![](06-20-18_12-05-45%C2%A0AM.png)
She inhaled deeply of the fresh outdoor air

![](06-20-18_12-07-10%C2%A0AM.png)
Whatever change awaited her, Emma knew she would figure it out.

![](06-20-18_12-14-34%C2%A0AM.png)
Besides, she had her family. And lord knew they would never change.

![](06-20-18_12-23-26%C2%A0AM.png)
Sara: "I still remember when I found out I was pregnant with you."

![](06-20-18_12-25-45%C2%A0AM.png)
Emma: "You really think I'm pregnant?"

![](06-20-18_12-26-17%C2%A0AM.png)
Emma: "That's a lot to take in. But how?" Anna: "It certainly would make sense."

![](06-20-18_12-27-07%C2%A0AM.png)
"I'm going to be a mother?!?"

![](06-20-18_12-28-25%C2%A0AM.png)
Emma: "What do you think?"

![](06-20-18_12-29-16%C2%A0AM.png)
Sara: "That's a kick!"

![](06-20-18_12-33-50%C2%A0AM.png)
Emma: "It must of have been the aliens!"

![](06-20-18_12-38-47%C2%A0AM.png)
Jane: "Sarila's right, that feels like you're going to have a little one of your own."

![](06-20-18_7-14-15%C2%A0PM.png)
Emma: "You're sure it's supposed to hurt this much?"
Sara: "Yeah, it does."

![](06-20-18_7-15-40%C2%A0PM.png)
Sara: "You're doing great Emma."

![](06-20-18_7-20-11%C2%A0PM.png)
Sarila: "You'll be ok, just breath honey."
