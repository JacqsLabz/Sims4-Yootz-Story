So I'm thinking:

# Emma

I like having Emma get in touch with more ghosts, maybe even becoming a witch.

# Anne

But also, Anne is away from her lover and her other daughter.

Oh! Anne and everyone were away camping the whole time Anne was pregnant the second time, so maybe Anne had no idea that Kaylie had her own pregnancy? Like she was out of town, and maybe Kaylie didn't want to say over the phone?

Well, that and Anne was so busy with 2 toddlers, and maybe she was so busy with a toddler and high school, that she had been trying to talk to her, but they simply didn't have the time? Idk, that feels like a pretty big deal.

I guess I just don't like that I missed this.

# But Brenda?

Well, ok: it could be they were being a bit more private for a time because Brenda was so little and an alien, so they weren't sure about how things would go?

Maybe for Brenda's sake, they kinda kept everyone away for a while. It started off as a family trip to the cabin, a chance for Anne to get away and relax while she was pregnant again. A chance to really focus on family.

But then it turned out Emma had an alien growing inside her. So it became a longer trip away from everyone.

Oh, Sara had been abducted before, maybe she could tell Emma had an alien? At least during that second check? Maybe they made the trip long at first because they had no idea. But then Sara checks again once she's further along, and in her dark form, Sara can tell Emma is carrying not her own child, but an implanted alien.

To keep Brenda safe, they secude themselves a bit. Not sure how the rest of the world will react to a full alien. Brenda was so young they didn't know if she would like show some one, being too youn to know better.

One thing they decided right away though was that Brenda was family, and they weren't going to let anyone hurt her. Emma didn't give a rat rather she shared any dna with Brenda or not (not sure rather she does), Brenda is her daughter.

Or, Sara could know right away that aliens can implant some people. She's been abducted & built a rocketship. She could say how they told her they were looking for being able to carry their kind, and that she was simply incombatable. Or she could have over heard them talking while she was up there?

That could give Sara more knowledge about them, and say knowing that some are a danger to aliens? Idk, I really ought to solve the strangerville thing to know what's down there. If they kept to their roots, then the military hates/fears the aliens, but who knows?

Maybe Sara remember enough from her travels in space & from what she saw when they took her to know where to find them? Or just because she wasn't compatiable? Or like the knockout drugs didn't work on her.

All I know is I want to set this up soon. And I might put Cassandra back to being mommy's little proper girl because she's probably going too? I'm not sure. I like the idea of her being Sara's rough & tumble little one, and I like the idea of less sims in this freaking house. These's too many of them & the house is way too big & has too much stuff everywhere.

Ok, so curing is a command in mccc.
