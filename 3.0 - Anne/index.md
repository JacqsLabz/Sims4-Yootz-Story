Anne started working her charms,

And they were quite effective.

Very effective.

And came into her own as a vampire,

Proving her place amoung other vampire and the members of her mother's coven.

"Hey mom, can vampire even get queezy? I've been feeling weird lately." Anne said.

"Really? It likely mean you're pregnant sweetie. Just wait a little while and get one of those tests." Sara hugged her.

So she did, having fun along the way.

And positive was her result.

But she still had some fun.

When she told Emma, she suggested they learn more about how to care for the little one.

Jane was excited, naturally.

Anne read even more about vampires, just to be as ready as she could.

![](06-14-18_7-36-36%C2%A0AM.png)

She took some time to relax

"Hi there little niece of nehew!" Emma said.

![](06-14-18_10-16-34%C2%A0AM.png)![](06-14-18_10-25-16%C2%A0AM.png)![](06-14-18_10-26-21%C2%A0AM.png)

Of course, it was news shared with the whole coven.

"Feels strong, as a born vampire of a born vampire should be." - `Actually no, this child is human. This is Cassandra that Anne is preggers with here so idk.`

"Time flies! Seems like it was just yesterday that you were that little!" Don said. "Congratulations!"

![](06-17-18_8-03-37%C2%A0AM.png)

"Mom, I think... Ah!"

![](06-17-18_8-03-54%C2%A0AM.png)



![](06-17-18_8-06-42%C2%A0AM.png)

Once it passed, Sara pulled her in for a hug. "Don't worry, you got this Anne."

![](06-17-18_9-43-48%C2%A0AM.png)![](06-17-18_9-45-32%C2%A0AM.png)

So everyone was there when Cassandra, daughter of Anne Yootz and Maki Hasegawa, was born.
