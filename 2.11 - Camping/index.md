After everything, Sara and Jane decided to take the girls on a vacation, to get away from it all at a cabin out in the woods.

They did things like playing cards,

and roasting marshmellows for a few days.

Savanna grew up into a teenager.

"That was really nice." Jane said.

"Yeah." Sara said.

"I can't take this house anymore!" Savanna came to shortly after the camping trip.

"What do you mean?" Jane asked.

"How about we all sit down?" Sara put on an uneasy smile.

Sara leaned in close to Jane and whispered, "She can't be serious, let me handle this.""

"Of course I'm serious!" Savanna yelled.

"Well, hold on." Sara turned to her daughter. "Hear us out first."

Jane and Sara made their case to Savanna about why she shouldn't move out as a teenage, which they both thought was a pretty convincing case.

When they were done, Savanna's voice was flat. "Neither of your are freaking listening to me."

"Honey, we just think," Sara started.

"That's it! I'm leaving and you can't stop me!" Savanna yelled.

Jane's face filled with rage as she stood.

But Sara saw her, recongized that type of look from the mirror. "Dear, stop, before you say something you might regret. Trust me."

Jane let Savanna walk past.

"I know it's hard." Sara said, "but breath."

Jane colapsed on the couch, defeated. "We're losing our other little girl."

"Look, with how old she is, short of mind control, we can't stop her. I don't want to lose them either, but we can't protect them from everything."
