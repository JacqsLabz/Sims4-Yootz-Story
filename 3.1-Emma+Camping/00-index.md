Emma and Jane went to the spice festival again.

And ran into Savanna.

Who attacked Emma.

But Emma showed Savanna.

Emma took a short trip the worlds beyond.

![](06-19-18_4-57-40%C2%A0PM.png)
"It was so weird." She told Anne about the experience.

![](06-19-18_5-07-08%C2%A0PM.png)
*'Did my stomach wither up like Sara's and Anne's'* Emma thought.

Anne was up to her usual romantic pursuits. This time with Kaylie Vatore, daughter of Lilith Vatore, who turned Sara (Anne's mother).

Meanwhile, Emma still wasn't sure about her stomach.

![](06-19-18_8-59-43%C2%A0PM.png)

But that didn't stop Anne & Emma from having random dance-off's.

![](06-19-18_10-03-19%C2%A0PM.png)

"So I have some great news everyone, I'm pregnant again!" Anne said.

![](06-19-18_10-07-37%C2%A0PM.png)

"I got an idea," Emma said, "How about we all go out to the cabin? It's so relaxing out there."

"That's sounds great." Anne said.

"Yeah, just like when you were two were young." Sara agreed, thinking about Cassandra.

Emma was still in pain, but she didn't draw attention to it.

![](06-19-18_10-18-19%C2%A0PM.png)

She tried the bloody marry drink her mother and sister lived on,

![](06-19-18_10-19-48%C2%A0PM.png)

but even that turned her stomach and made it cramp up with pain.

Meanwhile Anne had plenty of food to choose from.

Hey death, guess what?

One night Anne invited Emma to a game of cards.

![](06-19-18_10-34-09%C2%A0PM.png)

![](06-19-18_10-29-51%C2%A0PM.png)

Emma was busy thinking about a card when Anne spoke up. "Look, sis, I can tell something's been wrong."

![](06-19-18_10-34-22%C2%A0PM.png)
"I love this song."
"Look, sis, you can drop the act."

![](06-19-18_10-34-59%C2%A0PM.png)
"What act? What do you mean?"
"You might be able to hide it from our parents, but I can tell something's been wrong."

![](06-19-18_10-33-52%C2%A0PM.png)

"No I'm ok- ow."

![](06-19-18_10-31-22%C2%A0PM.png)
Emma stuggled to breath in as the pain sugered in her gut.

![](06-19-18_10-31-41%C2%A0PM.png)
"You need to talk to mom about it." Anne signaled Sara to come over to them.

![](06-19-18_10-43-08%C2%A0PM.png)
"But-" Emma started.
Sara sat down. "Emma, let us help you sweetie. We're family, we stick togehter."
Emma blushed and looked down at her lap. "Can I have a little time? Just to put my thoughts together."
Sara sighed, "Tomorrow then. But no more putting this off, got it?"
Emma nodded. "Ok."

In the next morning, she went on a hike to clear her mind and get her thougts in order.

![](06-19-18_11-46-23%C2%A0PM.png)

And found an old "friend"

![](06-19-18_11-49-00%C2%A0PM.png)

"I have to know, am I coming up on you list again any time soon?"

![](06-19-18_11-50-16%C2%A0PM.png)

"Child, it is not for me to speak of," the unearthly tone came from his hood, "it is not for mortal minds to know."

"I'm not a mortal, I'm a vampire. And you already came for me once. Can't you give me some idea, at least rather it will happen in the next few days." She opened her eyes and didn't hide her fear. "Please." she blink away a tear. "I keep feeling sicker and sicker..."

Death made a noise, Emma wasn't sure if it was a sigh.

![](06-19-18_11-49-42%C2%A0PM.png)

The Repear put his arms around her. "I can not say how long until I come for anyone, child." He dropped into a faint, whisper-like volume Emma could hardly hear, "But, I can say that this thing which you fear, it does not draw your soul to me."

![](06-19-18_11-57-25%C2%A0PM.png)

Emma came back outof the woods both shaken and relieved.

![](06-20-18_12-05-28%C2%A0AM.png)

She used the dark power of vampire to meditate for a little while to help calm her nerves, and then went inside to talk to her family.

![](06-20-18_12-14-34%C2%A0AM.png)

They were all hanging out at the bar, and sitting there, Emma couldn't help but think about how silly they all were, and how that would never change. Seeing them all just being themselves brougth her some peace of mind.
