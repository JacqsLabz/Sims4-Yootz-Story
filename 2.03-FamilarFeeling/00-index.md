One evening, a familar type of feeling came over Sara just as Jane got the girls tucked in for the night.

"Oh no, again?" Sara held her stomach.

![](12-12-17_4-29-44%C2%A0PM.png)

"Dear, what's wrong?" Jane sat down next to her.

![](12-12-17_4-34-06%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara swallowed. "It's my stomach... honestly it reminds me of the morning sickness, so I'm not sure."

![](12-12-17_4-32-03%C2%A0PM.png)

"So, you might be pregnant again? We going to have another wee little one? Or two?"

![](12-12-17_4-32-21%C2%A0PM.png)

"You're too cute dear." Sara watched her. "I'm not sure,"

![](12-12-17_4-33-47%C2%A0PM.png)

"But I have idea! If we wait a little while, I can take a test. Then we'll know for sure."

"That sounds great." Jane stood up. "Now come here."

When they woke up, Sara's stomach was still in knots.

So while Jane make breakfast again, Sara worked on fixing the shower. She found she had quite the knack for and enjoyed fixing the thing.

"Thanks for the fruit salad dear." Sara grabbed a bowl.

"Of course." Jane smiled and went to sit at the table.

![](12-12-17_4-43-03%C2%A0PM.png)

But something about the flavor was seriously off.

![](12-12-17_4-43-54%C2%A0PM.png)

"I'm not sure, mine tastes ok? I'll try making something else next time." Jane said.

That night was date night. Since the girls had been born, they had moved their dates to being at home, but still had fun getting dressed up for it.

"Come here, cutie." Sara pulled Jane close

to give her litle kisses.

When that same familar feeling washed over her,

![](12-12-17_4-49-59%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane took the lead, so to speak.

![](12-12-17_5-04-04%C2%A0PM.png)

Pancakes were even worse.

In time, Sara took to sometimes taking naps on their couch, because her stomach bothered her through the night so much that she couldn't sleep well. If anything, it seemed to be calmer during the day. Except when she tried to eat that was.

![](12-12-17_5-12-20%C2%A0PM.png)

But Jane of course didn't quit and tried ever different recipes. She made some sandwitches then woke Sara so she could try them.

![](12-12-17_5-13-40%C2%A0PM.png)

"They seem good to me, give them a try sweetie."

Sara blinked and reached for the sandwhich on her plate. "Yeah..."

![](12-12-17_5-14-09%C2%A0PM.png)

But no luck.

![](12-12-17_5-14-20%C2%A0PM.png)

"Don't worry, I have lots more recipes I can try for you dear, we'll find something you can eat." Jane was ever hopeful.

"Yeah, sure." Sara sighed. She was so hungry that she tried to eat the sandwhiches anyway.

![](12-12-17_5-19-44%C2%A0PM.png)

But that didn't work,

![](12-12-17_5-30-52%C2%A0PM.png)

as it all came back up.

![](12-12-17_5-31-32%C2%A0PM.png)

Though, Sara had to admit she had kinda expected that.

![](12-12-17_5-29-19%C2%A0PM.png)

Even coffee did not taste right.

![](12-12-17_5-20-48%C2%A0PM.png)

"I think I'm going to lay back down. Sorry, I'm just so tired." Sara yawned.

"I know dear, we'll get this figured out."

"Thank you for trying."

Jane hugged her.

When she could finally take the pregnancy test, Jane joined her.

![](12-12-17_5-35-24%C2%A0PM.png)

Even while doing the test, she felt sick. "If this thing is negative, then I have no idea what's wrong with my stomach."

![](12-12-17_5-35-57%C2%A0PM.png)

But it turned out ot be positive.

![](12-12-17_5-36-41%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-12-17_5-40-48%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane was getting the girls ready for bed one night, and Sara was about to turn in early, when a stabbing pain of hunger from her stomach almost had her doubled over.

![](12-12-17_5-40-38%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-12-17_5-42-25%C2%A0PM.png)

The feeling was so unfamilar this time.

![](12-12-17_5-42-41%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara yelled, "Jane!"

![](12-12-17_5-42-52%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-12-17_5-43-18%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane came running from the other room, but didn't get there before Sara was engolfed in the black smoke and magic.

Sara's mind went to the past, and memories she didn't recognize came to the surface.

![](12-12-17_5-44-01%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara needed answers. And as the smoke disapated, she knew where she needed to go to get them.
