"I've been thinking, what about a night out on the town?" Sara asked.

----

They decided to get a sitter and go out to the city right around sun down. It burned Sara a bit, but it wouldn't be long enough to really matter.

The started with stopping by the romance festival, and taking a few hits on a bubbleblower.

"This feeel different..." Jane hesitated.

"You'll get used to it." Sara smiled.

They made their way to a karaoke bar.

"Is it just me, or do you look hotter than normal?" Jane asked.

"I think someone had a bit much of the bubbles." Sara laughed, then stood. "Come here."

Sara tried her best to surpress the hiss as her need to feed filled her.

"Just wait here, and I'll be back soon. Ok love?"

Jane found herself weak in the knees. "Ok Sara."

She didn't need to even go far to find prey, there was some all around. As she swallowed, fresh blood filled her decayed whithered up belly.

"Hi there, welcome back." Jane sighed.

![](12-19-17_10-47-18%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara covered Jane in kissed, full and happy,

![](12-19-17_10-48-46%C2%A0PM.png)

she let her mouth wonder freely,

![](12-19-17_10-48-58%C2%A0PM.png)

At first Jane seemed to enjoy it,

![](12-19-17_10-49-50%C2%A0PM.png)

but she suddenly pulled back. "Wait."

"What is it? What's the matter?" Sara didn't hide her concern.

![](12-19-17_10-49-39%C2%A0PM.png)

"I... I felt your fangs. I think. I'm sorry. What if..." Jane looked away.

"What if what? What if I bit you?" Sara raised an eyebrow. "Then we'd be immortal together. What would be wrong with that?"

![](12-19-17_10-50-42%C2%A0PM.png)

Jane put her hands to her mouth, "I- I..."

![](12-19-17_10-50-48%C2%A0PM.png)

"I'm sorry," Jane sighed, "You're right."

![](12-19-17_10-52-48%C2%A0PM.png)

She sighed and looked down. "You're completely right. I'm just so scared. This fear doesn't make sense, but it is still there."

![](12-19-17_10-54-45%C2%A0PM.png)

"Come here." Sara caressed Jane's cheek.

![](12-19-17_10-55-07%C2%A0PM.png)

"Trust me?" Sara whispered.

Jane blink away a tear as she nodded up Sara.

"If you want my bite, then come here."

Jane stepped closer, and offered her neck.

![](12-19-17_10-54-00%C2%A0PM.png)

"Oh- oh my..." Jane held her gut as the pain spread through her entire midsection.

![](12-19-17_10-53-43%C2%A0PM.png)

"How long does this part last for?"

"Welcome to my world." Sara smirked, "Don't worry, I promise it is temporary."

![](12-19-17_10-55-53%C2%A0PM.png)

"Now come here, my little fledging-to-be."
