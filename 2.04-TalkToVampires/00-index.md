"We need to talk." Sara skipped any real greetings.

"Yes, I suppose we do. Let's sit." Lilith guestered to the couch and arm chairs.

Caleb stood "Do want me to join you sister?"

"No, that's ok."

As Caleb went back to his chess table, Sara's stomach churned.

But she managed to swallow it down, and followed Lilith.

![](12-12-17_6-54-32%C2%A0PM.png)

"You bit me, you turned me. Which is one thing, but it turns out I'm pregnant."

"Oh my! Congradutation!" Lilith stood and came near Sara. "I had no idea, but"

![](12-12-17_6-53-52%C2%A0PM.png)

"the bite is a gift. And I could sense that you wanted it."

![](12-12-17_6-53-20%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara's stomach churned with her conflicting mixure emotions, and knew she was about to lose the fight with her guts. "I'm going to be sick, do you even toilet?"

"Yes, that way." Lilith pointed.

![](12-12-17_7-01-00%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara made it just in time,

![](12-12-17_7-01-22%C2%A0PM.png)

for everything she had eaten recently to force it's way back out of her.

She felt weak as she stubbled back to the living room, and sat on the couch across from Lilith. "Sorry about that, I haven't been able to keep basically anything down."

![](12-12-17_7-06-28%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara list off things on her fingers, "Fruit, pancakes, even freaking coffee."

![](12-12-17_7-04-23%C2%A0PM.png)

"Ah, yes. You see, some of our kind can eat like the human. But for some, their stomach whithers. When it does, anything solid makes them sick."

"Whithers?"

"Yes, usually it happens over time, but it can happen as someone transforms. A change in your diet should give you much relief."

Lilith explained multiple things to Sarila, but when it came to using their dark powers, Lilith difered to Caleb.

Lilith stood, "Come this way, my brother is better at this then myself."

![](12-12-17_7-09-40%C2%A0PM.png)

"You have to learn to sense the dark power both in and around you."

![](12-12-17_7-13-56%C2%A0PM.png)

"Once you can feel the dark power, gather it."

![](12-12-17_7-14-07%C2%A0PM.png)

"Then expell it to do your bidding!" Then when his feet returned to the floor, "First try sensing for the dark power."

![](12-12-17_7-15-34%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara let instinct guide her, and found that she could feel the dark force of the vampires.

"You're quite the natural." Caleb remarked.

Sara left the Vatore siblings ready to put what she had learned to use.

So when she found some stranger, she let instinct take over and guide her.

She felt so evergized that she jogged home, and then kept running while she waited for Jane to get home.

![](12-12-17_7-24-21%C2%A0PM.png)

![](12-12-17_7-40-04%C2%A0PM.png)

So I have some odd news, well, good new, I know why I've felt so sick lately... I got bit by a vampire.

![](12-12-17_7-40-11%C2%A0PM.png)

"A vampire?" At first Jane thought she must be joking.

"Yeah I know it sounds crazy, but they also turned me."

![](12-12-17_7-40-22%C2%A0PM.png)

"So, me and this little one are vampires too now."

"Little one? Is the baby ok?"

Sara put her arms around Jane and hugged her.

![](12-12-17_7-41-26%C2%A0PM.png)

"I promise, we're both ok, me and the baby. You can feel for yourself."

![](12-12-17_7-42-33%C2%A0PM.png)

"Ok, yeah."

![](12-12-17_7-40-47%C2%A0PM.png)

"Wow, that kick feels stronger than Emma and Savanna." Jane smiled.

"Tell me about it." Sarila held her belly.
