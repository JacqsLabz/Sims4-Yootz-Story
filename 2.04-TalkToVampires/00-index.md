Sara knocked, and it was Lilith who answered the door. Lilith lead her in with little preamble, then addressed a man sitting at a chess table. "Caleb, this is Sara, the one I told you about."

"We need to talk." Sara said to Lilith, skipping any real greeting.

"Yes, I suppose we do. Let's sit over there." Lilith guestered to the couch and arm chairs.

Caleb stood, "Shall I join you, sister?"

"No, that is ok." Lilith said.

As Caleb went back to his chess table, Sara's stomach churned.

But she managed to swallow it down, and followed Lilith.

"You bit me, you turned me. Which is one thing, but what's more important is it turns out I'm pregnant."

"Oh my! Congradutation!" Lilith put her hands to her face. "I had no idea," stood and came near Sara,

"but the bite is a gift. And I could sense that you wanted it."

![](12-12-17_6-53-20%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara's stomach churned with her conflicting mixure emotions, and moan when she knew she was about to lose the fight with her guts. "I'm going to be sick, do you even have a toilet?"

"Yes, that way." Lilith pointed.

![](12-12-17_7-01-00%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara made it just in time,

![](12-12-17_7-01-22%C2%A0PM.png)

for everything she had eaten recently to force it's way back out of her.

She felt weak as she stubbled back to the living room, and sat on the couch across from Lilith. "Sorry about that, I haven't been able to keep basically anything down."

![](12-12-17_7-06-28%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara list off things on her fingers, "Fruit salad, pancakes, sandwhiches, even freaking coffee doesn't taste right."

![](12-12-17_7-04-23%C2%A0PM.png)

"Ah, yes. You see, most of our kind can eat like the humans do. But for others, their stomach withers up until it cannot tolerate solid food anymore. Typically, if it happens, it takes years or centries to happen. But you wouldn't be the first for the transformation itself to wither you insides."

Sara swallowed, and looked down at her midsection. So her gut was trashed? But she was still pregnant, the baby was clearly growing, and see needed to feed both of them... Feed. She was a vampire that needed to *feed*. "So, I need to drink blood then?" At first thought made her skin crawl. But as she pictured doing so, a thirsty hunger awoke within her, and that made it sound like the best idea in the world.

"That is one option. There is also a tree native to this area that bears the blood-fruit. Anyone who knows what they're doing behind a bar counter can make the fruit into a drink that serves as a nice alternative."

Lilith explained multiple things to Sara, but when it came to using their dark powers, Lilith difered to Caleb.

Lilith stood, "Come this way, my brother is better at this than myself."

![](12-12-17_7-09-40%C2%A0PM.png)

"You have to learn to sense the dark power both in and around you."

![](12-12-17_7-13-56%C2%A0PM.png)

"Once you can feel the dark power, gather it."

![](12-12-17_7-14-07%C2%A0PM.png)

"Then expell it to do your bidding!" After his feet returned to the floor, "First try sensing for the dark power."

![](12-12-17_7-15-34%C2%A0PM.png)

Sara let instinct guide her, and found that she could feel the dark force of the vampires.

"You're quite the natural." Caleb remarked.

Sara left the Vatore siblings ready to put what she had learned to use.

So when she found some stranger, she let instinct take over and guide her.

She felt so evergized that she jogged home, and then kept running while she waited for Jane to get home.

![](12-12-17_7-40-04%C2%A0PM.png)

So I have some odd news, well, good new, I know why I've felt so sick lately... I got bit by a vampire.

![](12-12-17_7-40-11%C2%A0PM.png)

"A vampire?" At first Jane thought she must be joking.

"Yeah I know it sounds crazy, but they also turned me."

![](12-12-17_7-40-22%C2%A0PM.png)

"So, me and this little one are vampires too now."

"Little one? Is the baby ok?"

Sara put her arms around Jane and hugged her.

![](12-12-17_7-41-26%C2%A0PM.png)

"I promise, we're both ok, me and the baby. You can feel for yourself."

![](12-12-17_7-42-33%C2%A0PM.png)

"Ok, yeah."

![](12-12-17_7-40-47%C2%A0PM.png)

"Wow, that kick feels stronger than Emma and Savanna." Jane smiled.

"Tell me about it." Sarila held her belly.
