Jane made sure to keep the girls busy

any time Sara fed, so they wouldn't see.

Jane found that Sara's vampire form didn't scare her,

not at all.

But the part where Sara was drinking from others, she didn't want the girls to see it. So she decided to bring it up in a gentle manner.

"Hey Sara, I know Lilith told you to avoid solid food, but I've been thinking... what if I ask her about any other alterntive to blood?"

"You know, I never thought to ask her that. Yeah, that sounds great. They live out in Forgotten Hollow."

So, not long after that, Jane ventured to the Vatore house. "Hey, Lilith!" Jane came near the vampire.

"Hey, Jane... right? What is it?"

"Is there any alternative to drinking blood what might work for Sara?"

"You want to help her?"

"Well, there is one way, but it might sounds a little weird..."

Lilith explained about blood fruit, and Jane got some planted in her garden as soon as possible.

Vald challenged Sara,

and she taught him to not mess with her.

While they wanted for the blood fruit to come to harvest, Sara made sure to drink plenty of extra blood for Anne's sake.

Sara could only be in the sun for short bits of time,

but did what she could to play with little Anne.

She loved all her girls dearly.
