Sara's knack for fixing things around the house eventually grew to building a rocket ship in the basement.

They went on a short camping trip, this time at an actual camp site.

Which only proved how much Jane missed the outdoors, even though she was rather sensitive to the sun light.

Thankfully, everyone still had a lot of death flowers left over from the ambrosia.

Sara took on the jungle vines.

And taught her daughters how to fish.

They found more artifacts,

and Sara started to put them toegther.

Sara made drinks for everyone.

![](06-06-18_10-32-02%C2%A0AM.png)
Sara started to experiment with what they could do.

"That thing makes me really uneasy." Jane said.

Sara pushed at the box's heavy lid

![](06-06-18_11-12-48%C2%A0AM.png)
"What? What is it?" Sara looked from Emma to Jane, and glanced behind herself.

"Your-your... your..." Emma guestered at Sara.

"I'm what?" Sara held out her arms and looked down at herself... to find her body was nothing but bones.

![](06-06-18_11-15-04%C2%A0AM.png)
She screamed, and ran ourside to the moonlight.

![](06-06-18_11-16-59%C2%A0AM.png)
But the moonlit night air didn't do anything.

![](06-06-18_11-18-05%C2%A0AM.png)
Sara tried to call on the dark powers of vampires, but still her hands were those of an animated skelton instead of her own.

![](06-06-18_11-15-10%C2%A0AM.png)
With her usual inhuman vampiric speed, Sara rushed back to her family. "I have an idea: I'm going back to the rental house."

![](06-06-18_11-19-37%C2%A0AM.png)
She got in the coffin in the basement, and went into vampiric hyberation, hoping it would heal her body.

![](06-06-18_11-43-38%C2%A0AM.png)
It took time, but it did work. Sara pulled Jane close, and help her while she sobbed. Jane was too relieved to even form sentances at first.

Once Jane calmed down, they went to the nearest bar to celebrate Sara being ok.

They tried to learn the local dances.

![](06-06-18_1-56-35%C2%A0PM.png)
They explored jungle more.

They found some more treasure.

Went they got back, everyone was happy to be safe back home.
