The four vampires all sat at the table together.

"Alright Emma, talk to us." Sara said.

<!-- ![](06-20-18_12-22-16%C2%A0AM.png) -->
"I'm not even sure where to start." Emma drank the last of her bloody marry, partly just to give her something else to do.

![](06-20-18_12-22-30%C2%A0AM.png)
"Just start from the begining." Sara said.

"Ok." Emma sat down her empty glass. "It started at home, before we left for vacation."

![](06-20-18_12-23-06%C2%A0AM.png)
"I started getting this weird pain in my stomach, and feeling like I was going to be sick. At first I didn't say anything because I didn't think it was a big deal; I just thought maybe it had weithered. I mean, yeah, that did seem a little weird, but nothing too bad."

"But then it just got worse, and I didn't want to worry anyone." Emma paused to get the words. "When we got here, trying to drink a blood marry made me feel so sick, and sent me double over in pain. It's been so bad that I haven't been drinking much, but still I've gained this weight. Which makes no sense. I know I can't be pregnant, I haven't you know..." Emma let it trail off.

Emma paused before she continued. "Honestly I saw death out in the woods, and I talked to him because I was so scared he was coming for me again. He said he isn't, but I still have no idea why my stomach feels so bad even though I'm also so tired, weak, and thirsty."

Anne spoke up, "What about when you were abducted? You said yourself it was rather strange."

![](06-20-18_12-26-17%C2%A0AM.png)

"I don't know; that's all so fuzzy." Emma guestered with her hand near her head. "Are you saying they made me pregnant? Or something else?"

![](06-20-18_12-27-37%C2%A0AM.png)
"I mean, we're vampires, and you were a ghost." Anne said.
"Yes, they can." Sara said. "When they took me, that said I was 'incompatable' and that finding a being who could carry their young was very rare. That gives me an idea." Sara stood up, "Come here for a moment."

![](06-20-18_12-35-00%C2%A0AM.png)
"Oh, ow." Emma moaned from the churning pain in her middle.

![](06-20-18_12-31-18%C2%A0AM.png)
Sara put her arms around her daughter and rubbed Emma's back. "We will figure this out. Now, let me see your stomach."

![](06-20-18_12-32-27%C2%A0AM.png)
Sara didn't even need to enter her dark form to feel it.

![](06-20-18_12-33-03%C2%A0AM.png)
"I can feel it, there's another life within you. You're going to have a little one of your own, Emma dear." Sara's grin was huge.

![](06-20-18_12-36-44%C2%A0AM.png)
Jane came over. "Did I hear that right? Another baby?"
"Yeah, apperently I'm pregnant." Emma's eye were a bit wide with disbelief, the words all but blew her mind.

![](06-20-18_12-37-08%C2%A0AM.png)
Jane offered a hug, "I'm glad you're ok sweetie."

Sara walked up to the fire, "I know we were planning on making tonight our last night here athe cabin, but I've been thinking. And I think it would be better to stay here longer."

Emma smiled up at her, "Sounds great to me." She got a marshmellow to roast on her strick.

![](06-20-18_12-56-26%C2%A0AM.png)

"Yeah, me too." Anne warmed her hands.

Jane smiled, "It is such fun being out here."

Sara took a minute to gather her thoughts. "Well, another thing they told me when I was up there," Sara looked slight up towards the sky, "is how some people... some people are a threat to them."

"A threat?" Emma looked up from roasting her marshmellow.

![](06-20-18_12-59-00%C2%A0AM.png)

"What, a monster going to come get them?" Anne guestered.

"Yes Cassie, I got you." Anne hugged Cassandra, before sending the little toddler back off to play agian. She stood up, and turned to her sister.

"It feel like she was born just yesterday, she's growing up so fast." Emma watched the toddler troddle off.

![](06-20-18_1-06-56%C2%A0AM.png)
"I don't think she's the only one. Your little one seems to be growing fast too."

Emma sighed. "Tell me about it... I feel so drained, part of me wishes it would slow down. I can't eat or drink hardly any blood fruit, and even when I do... it just puts my stomach in knotts instead of leaving me satified."

![](06-20-18_1-08-03%C2%A0AM.png)
Anne put her fingers to her mouth as she thought. "You know, I just had a though... have you tried eat non-blood fruit type things? I mean, since she, or he, is from another planet, maybe they have different needs?""

"I haven't... but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything."

![](06-20-18_1-19-46%C2%A0AM.png)
That seemed to make sense to Emma, so she tried it.
![](06-20-18_1-21-02%C2%A0AM.png)
She cooked up some turkey,
![](06-20-18_1-22-58%C2%A0AM.png)
Then sat down where everyone else was hanging out to try it.
![](06-20-18_1-24-24%C2%A0AM.png)
"I think you were right. Thanks Sis." Emma smiled, her stomach feeling calm and full for once.

The change to her diet seemed to cause a growth spurt for Emma's unborn baby; her belly grew even fast than before, but this time she had enough energy to not feel totally dead on feet.

Not long after the change to her diet, Emma's belly seemed to go through a growth spurt.

![](06-20-18_9-58-54%C2%A0AM.png)
So, Emma enjoyed many of the foods she hadn't touched in quite a long time.

![](06-20-18_9-59-50%C2%A0AM.png)
Meanwhile, Anne made sure to drink plenty of blood for her growing unborn little one.

![](06-20-18_10-07-39%C2%A0AM.png)
While taking time to take care of little Cassandra, of course.

<!-- ![](06-20-18_10-32-15%C2%A0AM.png)

Emma walked inot the kitchen to find Jane there. "Good monring."

Jane jumped a bit, then yawned. "Good morning. Sorry, I'm just not awake yet dear."

"Do you know where Sara is?" Emma asked. -->

Hey guys
![](06-20-18_7-27-40%C2%A0PM.png)
I think it's time

So they headed home.

![](06-20-18_8-31-07%C2%A0PM.png)
From the moment Brenda was born, Emma felt nothing but love for this little life. And promised herself that she would protect her daughter.
![](06-20-18_11-13-38%C2%A0PM.png)
She needed some time to recover, but stayed near her new daughter.

![](06-20-18_11-34-20%C2%A0PM.png)
They spent some time together as a family.
![](06-20-18_11-42-52%C2%A0PM.png)
Anne met her niece, and Cassandra was nearby.
