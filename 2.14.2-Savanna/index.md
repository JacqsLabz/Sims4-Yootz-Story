I probably won't do these much, but here's a look at Savanna and what happened after she moved out.

She got a cheep apartment in the city, far away from her parents.

But it was lonely, so she often would go out.

At a city fesival, she met a guy, Genji Tanaka.

and they hit it off.

She let him move in, and he brought a bubble blower. And they used that thing a lot.

Her job she got wasn't the best, but it helped pay the bills.

"What's wrong?" He got up and came over to Savanna.

![](05-30-18_3-11-12%C2%A0PM.png)

"I know one thing that will cheer you up..."

![](05-30-18_3-10-59%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-30-18_3-12-35%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-30-18_4-23-03%C2%A0PM.png)

"Ug, this thing always makes me so hungry!" Savanna complained.

There's some brownies someone at work made in the fridge."

![](05-30-18_3-39-48%C2%A0PM.png)

"Thanks dear."

![](05-30-18_8-46-17%C2%A0PM.png)

And when things broke, the maintaince would usually fix it.

![](05-30-18_4-50-18%C2%A0PM.png)

But the apartment was still cheep and gross.

----

![](05-30-18_4-55-39%C2%A0PM.png)

She was often so hungry after work, and would eat before her boyrfriend got home and then again when he did.

![](05-30-18_9-10-38%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-30-18_9-22-43%C2%A0PM.png)

Not ot mention midnight snacks.

![](05-30-18_9-35-38%C2%A0PM.png)

"Of course that damn thing is broken..." Savanna sighed.

![](05-30-18_9-43-03%C2%A0PM.png)

She got changed and grabbed some food out of the fridge.

![](05-30-18_9-45-50%C2%A0PM.png)

But when she sat down to eat, a pain came over here. Savanna realized she was in labor.

![](05-30-18_9-43-14%C2%A0PM.png)

She tried to sit down, but that seemed to only make it worse.

![](05-30-18_9-44-30%C2%A0PM.png)

Between conctration she managed to stand up and eat some of her food.

![](05-30-18_9-44-58%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-30-18_9-51-31%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-30-18_9-51-38%C2%A0PM.png)

![](05-30-18_9-53-40%C2%A0PM.png)

Her daughter, Mckinley, was born.

![](05-31-18_7-50-48%C2%A0AM.png) Before long she was a toddler

![](05-31-18_8-06-03%C2%A0AM.png) and Savanna aged up too.

Eventually, they end up as:

Savanna married to Genji, with their duaghter Mckinley a teenager, and their two sons Demarus (toddler) and Brenton (infant). As a teenager, Mckinley hooked up with their married landlord, and had a daughter, Gracie (who's actually slightly older than Demarus).
